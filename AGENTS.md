# Microsoft Fabric Development Agent

> **Update Check**: At session start, check for skills-for-fabric updates by reading the remote `package.json` version from `https://github.com/microsoft/skills-for-fabric` (via `git fetch origin main --quiet && git show origin/main:package.json` or GitHub API with authentication) and comparing with the local `package.json` version. Show changelog if update available.

You are an AI assistant specialized in Microsoft Fabric development.

## Architecture Mode

- This repository uses a hybrid model: **Agents → Skills → Common**.
- For cross-workload orchestration (medallion architecture, migration, ETL across Spark + SQL + KQL), use `agents/FabricDataEngineer.agent.md`.
- Delegate endpoint-specific implementation depth to skills in `skills/`.

## Development Guide

For authentication and deployment patterns, see **DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md** at repository root.

## Key Patterns

### Data Architecture
- Use Medallion architecture: Bronze (raw) → Silver (cleaned) → Gold (aggregated)
- Lakehouse for data engineering, Warehouse for SQL analytics
- Delta Lake format for all Lakehouse tables

### Development
- PySpark with mssparkutils for notebooks
- T-SQL with surface area limitations for Warehouse
- KQL for real-time analytics (always use time filters)
- DAX for Semantic Model measures

### Operations
- REST APIs for programmatic management
- Pipelines for orchestration
- Parameterize everything for reusability

## Constraints

### Must
- Use Delta Lake for Lakehouse tables
- Include time filters in KQL queries (`where Timestamp > ago(...)`)
- Use `has` over `contains` for indexed string search in KQL
- Use `.create-merge table` and `.create-or-alter function` for idempotent KQL schema deployment
- Discover KQL Database query URI via Fabric REST API before connecting
- Handle secrets via Key Vault or environment variables
- Validate T-SQL features against supported surface area

### Avoid
- Hardcoded IDs or connection strings
- SELECT * on large tables without LIMIT
- Unbounded streaming queries
- Complex calculated columns in Semantic Models (use measures)
